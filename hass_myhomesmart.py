# Today we can enjoy several devices called "smart"; devices that seem to possess reasoning, logic and
# deduction skills in performing seemingly spontaneous actions. In reality, this is not the case at all,
# each device is programmed to do actions under certain conditions, without any understanding of what it is
# doing and the possible consequence that such actions can do. For example, smart speakers simply read what
# they find on the web, but they don't know if what they read is right or they cause the user to do the
# wrong thing. A smart television is not smart, it just offers more opportunities for digital services.
# And so on.
# Giving intelligence to home automation means giving a logical and comprehensive reasoning to the action
# that the home automation system should do to reach a certain objective.
