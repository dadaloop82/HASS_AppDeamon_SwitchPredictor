# I have a dream
## make my life smarter without creating any automation!
Based on the analysis of the change of a certain switch (set in configuration), the system analyzes the change of the sensors in that moment
So it creates a model, divided by periods (including seasons, etc. ..) trying to guess their habits and if the conditions are similar, it proposes via Alexa the activation of the switch, learning from the answers given.
If the probability of activation is very high, the action could be performed automatically without any iteration with the user.

# Use case example

- An automation is automatically created to start the robot vacuum cleaner when nobody is at home, the time slot is from 14:00 to 18:00, the balcony door is closed and the humidity is below 60%.

- An automation is automatically created to turn on the television when someone is at home, it is between 20:00 and 22:00, dinner is being served, the temperature in the house is above 22°C and there is no upcoming appointment on the calendar.

- Asked if you want coffee if the time slot is from 12:00 to 14:00, someone is at home, you have just finished having lunch, the temperature at home is below 25°C - if not, the model is modified 

Warning: all these automatic automations are based on actions already performed previously, according to probabilistic calculations. 

**It is not foreseen that the system considers to ask or to execute actions in a completely spontaneous way.**
